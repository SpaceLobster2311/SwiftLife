# About Swift
Swift is a great way to write for software on phones, desktops, servers and pretty much anything that runs code. 
Swift is freindly to new programmers.  

### Swift Defines away large classes of common programming errors by adopting modern programming patterns:
* Variables are **always** initialized before use
* Arry indices are checked for out-of-bound errors
* Integers are checked for overflow. 
* Optionals ensure that nil values are handled explicitly 
* Memory is manged automatically 
* Error handling allows controlled recovery of unexpected failures.
