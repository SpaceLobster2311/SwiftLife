# Basic Syntax

### The most Basic:

print("Hello World")

*notice how the quotes are doubled not single*

## Simple Values

**LET** makes a constant 
*constants must be assigned a value exactly once*

**VAR** makes a variable 

As always variables can be changed around. 


## Type Annotations

You *can* provide a type annotation when you declare a constant or varialbe.  This will help you be clear about what kind of values the constant or variable can store.

You can write a type annotation by placing a colon after the name of the constant or variable. Followed by a space, then followed by the name of the type to use. 
 *example*.  var welcomeMessage: String
 
 The colon in the declaration above means ".. of type.." so that the code above can be read as: "Declare a variable called welcomeMessage that is a type of String.
 
 The phrase of "type of string" means that variable can store any string value. 
 
 The welcomeMessage varaible can now be set to any string value without having an error.
 
 weclomeMessage = "Hello" 
 
 You can also define multiple variable that are related on a single line. They need to be seperated by commas with a single type annotation after the last variable in the list. 
 *ex* var red, blue, green: Double
 
 ## Naming Constants and Variables 
 
 Constants and Variables can contain almost any character, including unicode characters. 
 
 Constant and variable names canâ€™t contain whitespace characters, mathematical symbols, arrows, private-use Unicode scalar values, or line- and box-drawing characters. Nor can they begin with a number, although numbers may be included elsewhere within the name.
